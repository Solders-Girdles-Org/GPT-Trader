## Overview

GPT-Trader is a command-line trading system for Coinbase, built as vertical feature slices behind a dependency-injection container, with layered risk management and an auditable trade-idea pipeline. The name reflects how AI assistants collaborate in developing this codebase; current trading strategies use technical analysis and rule-based decisioning, not LLM inference.

**Direction.** The long-term goal is an autonomous trading entity — a bot that observes markets, does its own research, and manages funds inside machine-enforced limits. The accepted path is staged autonomy: AI-produced trade-idea records with human approval first, then bounded autonomy per strategy envelope once the risk, audit, and kill-switch rails have a track record. [Direction](docs/DIRECTION.md) owns the staged ladder and the execution gates; [Project Status](docs/STATUS.md) tracks where we actually are.

**Scope.** Coinbase only, spot plus CFM futures. INTX perpetuals were removed, not frozen (see the [removal decision](docs/decisions/intx-default-derivatives-venue.md)). Existing live profiles and broker-specific paths are implementation assets, not approval to trade: expanding or enabling them requires explicit readiness, venue-capability, approval, and audit gates.

### Trading Capabilities

| Mode | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Spot trading** | Implemented | Coinbase spot paths exist; use only with explicit profile and readiness gates |
| **CFM futures** | Implemented, gated | US-regulated futures paths exist; require account, product, and risk-gate verification |
| **INTX perpetuals** | Removed | `COINBASE_ENABLE_INTX_PERPS` survives only as a deprecated alias; semantics live in [Deprecations](docs/DEPRECATIONS.md) |
| **AI-assisted execution** | Staged rollout | Human-approved trade ideas first; bounded autonomy is the accepted destination ([current state](docs/STATUS.md)) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the trading bot
uv run gpt-trader run --profile dev
```

## Configuration

### Trading Profiles

| Profile | Broker | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `dev` | DeterministicBroker (mock) | Local development |
| `paper` | Mock execution | Real-data strategy checks without exchange orders |
| `observe` | Real data, execution blocked | Read-only market/account observation |
| `canary` | Real (tiny limits) | Production validation only after readiness review |
| `prod` | Real | Legacy live profile; do not treat as approval for unrestricted production use |

### Environment Setup

Copy the template and configure your credentials:

```bash
cp config/environments/.env.template .env
```

Key variables:
- `COINBASE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, or `COINBASE_CDP_API_KEY` + `COINBASE_CDP_PRIVATE_KEY` — JWT credentials
- `--profile` (CLI flag) — trading profile (`dev`/`paper`/`observe`/`canary`/`prod`)

See [config/environments/.env.template](config/environments/.env.template) for minimal operator defaults and
[var/agents/configuration/environment_variables.md](var/agents/configuration/environment_variables.md) for the full, code-derived inventory.

## Development

### Scaffold a New Slice

```bash
make scaffold-slice name=<slice> flags="--with-tests --with-readme"
```

Or run directly:

```bash
uv run python scripts/maintenance/feature_slice_scaffold.py --name <slice> --dry-run
```

### Quality Gates

```bash
# Linting and formatting
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run black .

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/gpt_trader

# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Check naming conventions
uv run agent-naming
```

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, default)
uv run pytest tests/unit -q

# With coverage
uv run pytest tests/unit --cov=src/gpt_trader -q

# Property-based tests
uv run pytest tests/property -q
```

### Local CI Profiles

The canonical local validation command is `uv run local-ci`. Its default `pr`
profile matches the GitHub `pull_request` required-check surface — run it
before opening a PR (`make ci-required` is a thin alias). Use
`uv run local-ci --profile quick` for fast development feedback (skips
readiness inputs, agent-artifact freshness, and the
property/contract/integration suites, with explicit banners), and
`--profile strict` when you also need local-live readiness evidence.

When strict/full fails on stale generated artifacts, run
`uv run agent-regenerate` and then `uv run agent-regenerate --verify`. When it
fails on readiness inputs, refresh the canary inputs with `make canary-daily`
or follow the profile-specific commands in
[`docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md#local-ci-troubleshooting).

### Test Guardrails

- Keep `test_*.py` modules within the line limit enforced by
  `scripts/ci/check_test_hygiene.py` (currently 400 lines unless allowlisted);
  policy details live in [docs/test_hygiene.md](docs/test_hygiene.md).
- Patch-style mocking is blocked in `tests/`; use `monkeypatch.setattr`.
- Avoid `time.sleep` in tests; use the `fake_clock` fixture for deterministic time.
- Marker conventions are enforced by folder (unit/integration/contract/real_api).

When you rename or move tests, regenerate the testing inventory:

```bash
uv run agent-regenerate --only testing
```

### Agent Tools

Commands for AI-assisted development. The canonical local quality gate is
`uv run local-ci` (`make ci-required` is a thin alias); these helpers are
optional conveniences on top of it:

```bash
uv run agent-check      # Optional JSON summary of lint/format/types/tests
uv run agent-impact     # Analyze change impact
uv run agent-map        # Generate dependency graph
uv run agent-naming     # Check naming conventions
uv run agent-pr-ready   # Reconcile PR mergeability vs green CI
```

## Architecture Notes

This project uses **dependency injection** via `ApplicationContainer` in `src/gpt_trader/app/`. The legacy `orchestration/` layer was removed during the DI migration; prefer `app/` and `features/` paths.
